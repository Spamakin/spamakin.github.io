.SH Description
    Math Major @ UIUC with a large interest in Abstract Algebra and Algorithms

    My interest generally lies in analyzing structures and problems with a seemingly minimal set of constraints and exploring all the possibilities that arise from the inclusion and exclusion of these rules and limitations. In mathematics this is manifested in my love for Abstract Algebra and how so many interesting properties in structures can arise from a set of axioms. Similarly my interest in Algorithms arises from analyzing various algorithms and heuristics that can be used to obtain an optimal performance. I apply this mindset not only my coursework in these fields but also to any internships, projects, or my ongoing research. I have alot of fun trying to extract as much speed and ability from systems that may at first glace seem too restrictive, whether it's greater algorithmic efficiency or gleeming more information from a data set or any other insights or gains in ability.

    Currently a Course Assistant for \fICS173\fP and doing research for the \fILEADCAT\fP lab under Melkior Ornik.

    Former software engineering intern for \fISiteIQ\fP.
